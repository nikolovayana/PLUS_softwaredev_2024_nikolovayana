## Workflow
1. I forked and cloned the geo-software-direcctory to a locel repo on my PC.

2. Then I created the environmetns from the .yml files. One mistake I made at first is that I did not change the directory to the exact same place as the .yml filesand I got the following error:

After using cd and dir I got into the directory where the .yml files are and manged to create them succesfully.

## Results
### software_dev_v1.yml

## Notes
Both environments were created without error messages, however vor the software_dev_2.yml much more time was needed.
