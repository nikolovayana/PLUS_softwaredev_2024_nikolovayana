# Hello from David  
Hey Yana. Nice to see you in another course. 

- A quote I like: 
'If you are going through hell, keep going.' - Churchill 
- Food I don't like:
Cheesecake - the consistency...I don't know. 
- Recommendation: 
If you ever want to learn French check ARTE.TV. A German French tv and radio channel with documentaries, movies or podcasts in both languages with subtitles. 
- An important german word: 
Autobahn - people are crazy about the highways (at least in Germany where everyone can go crazy fast).
